/**
 Check if edit distance between two strings is one
 An edit between two strings is one of the following changes.

 Add a character
 Delete a character
 Change a character
 Given two string s1 and s2, find if s1 can be converted to s2 with exactly one edit.
 Expected time complexity is O(m+n) where m and n are lengths of two strings.

 Examples:

 Input:  s1 = "geeks", s2 = "geek"
 Output: yes
 Number of edits is 1

 Input:  s1 = "geeks", s2 = "geeks"
 Output: no
 Number of edits is 0

 Input:  s1 = "geaks", s2 = "geeks"
 Output: yes
 Number of edits is 1

 Input:  s1 = "peaks", s2 = "geeks"
 Output: no
 Number of edits is 2
