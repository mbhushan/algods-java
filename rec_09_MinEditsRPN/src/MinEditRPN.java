/**
 Imagine x is an operand and * is a binary operator.
 We say a string of x and * follows Reverse Polish notation if it is a postfix notation.

 For example strings xx*, x, and xx*xx** follow Reverse Polish notation.

 Given a string of x and *, how many insert, delete, and replace
 operations are needed to make the string follow the RPN.

 For example, xx* need 0 operation to follow RPN since it already follows RPN.
 x*x needs two operations to become xx* which follows RPN.
 *xx* needs one operation to become xx* which follows RPN.

 Your algorithm should work for a string of size up to 100
