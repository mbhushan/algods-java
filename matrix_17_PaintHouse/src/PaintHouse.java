 LeetCode â€“ Paint House (Java)

 There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the three colors: red, blue or green.
 The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such
 that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

 The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x 3 cost matrix.
 For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color red; costs[1][2] is the cost
 of painting house 1 with color green, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.
